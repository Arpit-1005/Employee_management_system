Project Implementation

1. Project Setup-
Framework: 
Used Spring Boot for the project framework.
Dependencies: 
Included Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools, and Spring Boot Actuator for web support, 
live reload, and application health respectively. Also, include spring-boot-starter-web for RESTful 
application development and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa if you're interacting with a database.

2. Model Creation-
Employee Model:
Created an Employee class that will serve as the model. If you're using JPA for database operations.
Include fields such as id, name, department, etc., with appropriate JPA annotations.

3. Repository Layer-
Employee Repository: 
If interacting with a database, create an EmployeeRepository interface that extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> 
to handle CRUD operations for Employee entities.

4. Service Layer-
Employee Service: 
Implemented an EmployeeService class that contains business logic. It should use EmployeeRepository for database operations. 
This class is where you'd add methods for handling business logic not directly related to database CRUD operations.

5. Controller Layer-
DpController: 
Provided DpController class is part of the controller layer, handling HTTP requests. 
Complete the updateEmployee method and ensure all mappings (@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PutMapping) are correctly implemented.

6. External Service Integration-
The DpController interacts with an external service (http://localhost:9090/em/) using RestTemplate. 
Ensure this service is accessible. Consider using @LoadBalanced with RestTemplate if you're using service discovery.

7. Configuration-
Application Properties: 
Configured application properties in application.properties or application.yml. 
This includes server port, database configurations, and any external service URLs.

8.Security-
Spring Security: 
If your application requires authentication and authorization, integrate Spring Security.
Configure security policies for your endpoints.

9.Testing-
Unit Tests: 
Write unit tests for your service layer using JUnit and Mockito.
Integration Tests: 
Write integration tests for your controller layer using @SpringBootTest and TestRestTemplate or MockMvc.

10.Monitoring-
Actuator: 
Utilized Spring Boot Actuator to monitor your application's health, metrics, and configurations.
